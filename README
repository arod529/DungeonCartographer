This Program is under active development, and currently has no version number.
Some features are incomplete, or missing all together.

Dungeon Cartographer is a grid mapping program. It provides an easy and quick
method to draw grid or tile based maps. The maps can have multiple levels, each
of different size. Expanding rooms is as easy as clicking, as an intelligent
algorithm selects the correct tile. There are currently 48 unique tiles used to 
visually describe rooms.

A Tileset is a file that describes a collection of tile images, and is used to
draw the map. A boring default set is provided, but custom images can be created
by the user. Svg files are recommended for use as tiles for their ability to
scale, but other standard images types will also work.

Currently maps can be saved and opened, levels can be draw, and some editing
features such as shifting are functional.

Other core features are in line for development.

A proper distribution does not exist yet, but a a windows binary for preview
purposes can be downloaded from the following link. Download all the files and
folders in the link to a folder.
